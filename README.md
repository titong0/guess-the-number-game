# Guess the number game

I know there are better, less boring names, I couldn't come up with one so it stays this way.

Not particularly proud of the design but the programming part was a fun challenge

## [See the project](https://guess-the-combination.netlify.app/)



### What is going on?
what the website does is it generates puzzles like this one.

#### What is going on, again?
This is how you play:
* A code, which is three digit number is generated, Lets say 219. Your objective is to deduce what those three digits are (digits' order matters)
* Then, You are given other numbers as hints, and you see how they fit with the actual code. For example:
* The number 963 has one of the digits (9) but its in the first place, whereas in the code its in the second one

I started the project thanks to the book "matemática...¿estás ahí?" from Adrian Paenza and its chapter called "El juego del numerito".
Usually 4-7 hints are enough to guess the number
